# worklist.vim


Allows you to easily keep track of a todo list in the form of lines in the code
that you wish to return to. Instead of leaving a TODO comment or jumping to a
TODO file and trying to explain the context, simply add the line to the
worklist and don't let yourself complete your current task until all items in
the worklist have been handled. Let the line itself speak to the context of the
item, or add a note to the item in the worklist.

## Installation
